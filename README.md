# Project Overview

## Project Name

Weather App

## Project Description

The Weather App will take a location (city or zipcode) input from a user and return the current weather for that geo.  By leveraging the OpenWeather API, we can ensure our users are recieving the most up to date weather information avaialable. 

## API and Data Sample

OpenWeather API - https://openweathermap.org/current
```
  "main": {
    "temp": 282.55,
    "feels_like": 281.86,
    "temp_min": 280.37,
    "temp_max": 284.26,
    "pressure": 1023,
    "humidity": 100
  },
  ```

- Leverage user inputted location field to retrieve desired weather information
- Update page background based on current wearther description.  I.e.  Clear Sky changes to a background iamge of a clear sky.

PostMVP
- Drop down for incompleted string inputs (I.e. User Input = Salem, drop down menu for all options containing Salem.)
- 5 Day forecast
- Interactive Weather Map
